# Off-by-One Error in Java
This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in Java array access and its solution.
The `bug.java` file contains code that attempts to access an array element beyond its bounds, leading to an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.  The `bugSolution.java` file provides the corrected code.
This is a simple but illustrative example of a frequently encountered error in programming.
